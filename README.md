# Mapping-MITRE-ATT-CK-to-PCI-DSS

Thank you for your interest in mapping MITRE ATT&CKâ„¢ to the PCI DSS.

In this github you'll find a spreadsheet with my original mappings, the PCI Community Meeting edition of my talk, plus a longer version that I have given when not bound to the 20 min. time limit.

If you are interested in seeing the "long" version of the talk you can find it here:

There is also a 'Security Weekly Virtual Hacker Summer Camp' version on youtube you can find here:

Or simply search for this episode on youtube: "SWVHSC: Mapping MITRE ATT&CK to PCI DSS - Jeff Man - ESW #193"

Otherwise, feel free to review my work and compare to your take on the mappings. 

There is actually an updated version of MITRE ATT&CK that has not been mapped yet - mostly several hundred new "sub-techniques".

I'm curious to see how your mappings might differ from mine, particularly whether you agree with the explicit/implicit/need to squint categories.

Find the current version of the PCI DSS here: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library

Have at it!
